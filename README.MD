## 📜 About <a name = "about"></a>
Jingle is a high-level general-purpose programming language currently in development. It is statically-typed, inferred and structural. "So why would I use this?", I hear you ask. Well, Jingle is written in very simple, English-like syntax. This makes it much easier for beginners without adding complexity or removing functionality for advanced programmers. It is also targets the JVM.

## 📔 Examples <a name = "examples"></a>
Alright, let's look at how this all works. Here are 2 Hello World applications written in both Java & Jingle, with Java being on top and Jingle being on bottom.

```java

public class HelloWorld {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello, World");
  }
  
}
```
`display: ("Hello World")`

As you can see, Jingle is a lot simpler and in this case, just makes more sense. Its syntax is more similar to scripting languages and lines that you would enter into a command prompt, rather than convoluted solutions to incredibly simple tasks. View more examples [here](https://github.com/exedys/jingle-lang/wiki/Syntax-Examples-and-Reference).

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

We recommend usage of a IDE or text editor that supports Jingle. Main ones that are supported are:
* Eclipse 
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Visual Studio Code
* Sublime Text *(Coming Soon)*
* Atom *(Coming Soon)*

### Installing

You can get Jingle through our Jingle Packs at getjingle.org. These will include the binaries, offline documentation, examples and Jingle's package manager, JinglePkg. The Jingle Pack will also create a PATH variable so you can use Jingle straight from the Command Prompt straight away. Check if your installation succeeded by running `jingle` into the console. This should show the following:
```
Jingle Lang v1.x - (c) Exedys Synergies/ Millo Evers 2019
run "jingle help" for commands
``` 

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
As Jingle is a general-purpose programming language, its intended usage is to be up to the user and for them to use it for whatever they need it for. However, because it is still a very new language, Jingle cannot be used for as many things other languages can be used for. This is mostly because other languages have a lot of frameworks, libraries, plugins, extensions, etc... that allow developers do what they want. However for most plain/raw usage it should suffice. The language targets the JVM however which will help it support pre-existing libraries.

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
